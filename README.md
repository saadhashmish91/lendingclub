## General Information
> A consumer finance company gives loans to urban consumers. Their main goal is to provide loans to customers who will pay it back and NOT to people who will default. The main objective of this case study is to:
-	identify patterns which indicate if a person is likely to default
-	What necessary actions to take for those identified patterns

## Conclusions
-   Grades, Purpose of Loan, Employment Duration, Loan Amount and revolving line utilization, interest rate are most important parameters that impact loan_status
-   The bank should be cautious of customers who do not enter employment duration â€“ they have the highest default rates of any other value
-   Grade is the easiest way to identify defaulting customers (it is also highly corelated with interest rate)
-   Revolving line utilization is directly proportional with higher default rates.
